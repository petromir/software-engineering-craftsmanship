# Software Engineering Craftsmanship

This repository focuses on sharing my knowledge about making and delivering well-crafted software, with focus on:
- System Architecture
- Software Design and Development
- Standardization
- Processes

## Structure
Each of the above groups contains separate documents (written in Markdown) targeting a single topic.
Code examples, when needed, are written in Java (the best programming language ðŸ˜Ž).  

## Software Design and Development
- [Backwards-compatibility](../master/software-design-&-architecture/Backwards_Compatibility.md)
